# Encrypted-Chat-System
Using RSA Algorithm, this system provides an encrypted way to chat for two users on different devices.
The code uses socket programming and the in built libraries in Java for the RSA algorithm. The server is named Eve, and the client is named Adam. The server should be run first and then the client. 
Initially, the public keys are exchanges between them. First adam can send a message and then eve can reply and so on. 
Encrypted message is received and on giving confirmation, message can be decrypted and viewed. 
RSA.java contains the main functions for encrypting and decrypting
